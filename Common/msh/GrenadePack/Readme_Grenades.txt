These are the grenademodels I made for ARC_Commander and Syth.

This pack includes the models and textures for the:
-ECgrenade from Repuplic Commando
-Sonicgrenade from Repuplic Commando
-Protoncharge from EP 6
-Globetonator

Both models and textures were 100% made by me with XSI and GIMP.

As a bonus I included the unused highrez Thermaldetonator from the assets
I fixed. (the hardpoints werent set correctly)

I checked the models for invisible polygons or other bugs but if you still 
find any uncleanness, you can PM me on gametoast.com or post it in
the releasethread.

You are allowed to reskin everything, but if you want to edit the models in
any way YOU HAVE TO ASK ME FOR PERMISSION BEFORE!!

And the credits are going to:
-pandemic for the shipped model and texture.
-Wookiepedia for reference pictures.
-ARC_Commander and Syth for requesting the models
-Everyone who helped me with XSI.
-The whole Gametoast community for doing what they do.
