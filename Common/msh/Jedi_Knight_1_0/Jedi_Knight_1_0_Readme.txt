Q: Is this usefull to me? I can't mod. I just like to DL maps.

A: Nope, this is just models, textures, and a couple odf's, no mod.

-------------------
Q: What is included?

A: Five Jedi models. Male Hooded, Male Hood Down, Female Hooded, Female Hood Down, Anakin Hooded.
   Eight skins. Two each for male and female, plus two for the hood down versions, plus two for Anakin.
   They also use the deathstar Leia skin (female) and ep3anakin skin (Anakin) which are stock, although you might want to adjust the hand color for the female.

-------------------
Q. How do I use these?

A. Place all msh and tga files in your custom side's msh folder, then place the odf's in your custom side's odf folder. Edit or add a Jedi or other unit's odf to use the msh and cloth odf. (you may need to load the hood up msh's or do a simple hex edit and make new cloth odf's, I'm not sure)
   Hex editting will be a good way to apply different textures and create a variety of units.

-------------------
Q. Are we allowed to reskin these?

A. Yes. Please, do not reskin them to be less than modest. (speciffically the Female) And please remember to credit.

-------------------
Q. What about importing them and editting the models?

A. If you absolutely must, yes, with credits.
